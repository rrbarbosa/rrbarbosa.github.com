I am Brazilian born in Vila Velha, Espírito Santo. Currently, I work as a researcher at <a title="http://www.encs.eu/" href="http://www.encs.eu/">European Network for Cyber Security.</a> I recently obtained my Ph.D degree from the University of Twente, working at the <a title="http://www.utwente.nl/ewi/dacs/" href="http://www.utwente.nl/ewi/dacs/">Design and Analysis of Communication Systems</a> group. My thesis is entitled Anomaly Detection in SCADA Systems - A Network Based approach. In 2009, I received my M.Sc. in Telematics from the same University. Back in Brazil, I received my bachelor degree in 2007 from the <a title="http://portal.ufes.br/" href="http://portal.ufes.br/">Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)</a>.<br /><br />

I am currently investigating how to perform intrusion detection based on the observation of network-wide behaviors. My topics of interest include intrusion detection, network measurements and Industrial Control Systems.
